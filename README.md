## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
#card-result {
    height: 400px;
    width: 300px;
    border-radius: 25px;
    background-image: linear-gradient(hsl(252, 100%, 67%), hsl(241, 81%, 54%));
    margin-left: auto;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    text-align: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```
```

It's was a hard path learning flexbox and using it. But now i feel more confident with it. Additional CSS is hard but is funny. I had a lot of fun developing this.
